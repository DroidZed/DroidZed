Hi, I've moved to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/DroidZed) due to GitHub being so bad (I hate copilot and AI slop).

You will find my repositories there, if not then I haven't migrated them yet.
Once I migrate a repo from GH, it's gone for good and the link pointing to it won't work anymore. Please update your links to point to their respective codeberg upstream.

Thanks for understand and happy coding !
